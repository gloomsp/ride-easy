      <h2>About the Piaggio MP3</h2>
      <p>Piaggio’s MP3 pioneered the leaning three‑wheeler concept and continues to set the standard for stability and safety.  The latest MP3 models are powered by a high‑performance engine (available in 400 cc and 530 cc versions) coupled with independent front suspension that allows the front wheels to tilt into corners.  The result is scooter‑like convenience with motorcycle‑like confidence.</p>
      <p>Advanced electronics are a big part of the 530 hpe Exclusive model: ABS and ASR (anti‑slip regulation) come standard, with three selectable engine modes (Comfort, Eco and Sport), cruise control, and even a reverse gear with a backup camera.  A Blind Spot Information System and Lane Change Decision Aid alert you to nearby vehicles, while keyless ignition, LED lighting and a reshaped seat improve everyday usability.</p>
      <p>Because the MP3 is classified in Europe under the car‑licence (Category B) rules, it’s perfect for riders who want to explore without a full motorcycle licence.
